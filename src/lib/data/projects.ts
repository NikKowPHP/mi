    longDescription: `Lexity is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to revolutionize language learning by shifting the focus from passive consumption to active creation. The application leverages a deeply integrated AI core to provide a personalized, adaptive, and effective writing-centric learning experience. Users improve by doingâ€”receiving instant, contextual feedback, engaging in robust drilling exercises on their specific mistakes, and visualizing their predicted path to fluency.

A key feature is the "Write -> Analyze -> Practice" loop. A user writes, the AI analyzes mistakes, and for each mistake, the user can start a Practice Session. This triggers a robust AI-powered drilling feature that generates new, targeted exercises to reinforce the correct concept.

The system utilizes a multi-provider AI strategy to balance cost, speed, and capability, using powerful models like Google Gemini for complex analysis and high-speed models like Cerebras/Groq for instant translations.`,

The admin dashboard was particularly challenging - I wanted administrators to be able to configure and manage every section of the website dynamically, which meant diving deep into state management and database operations.\n\nBuilding this taught me that creating something that looks simple on the surface often requires solving complex problems behind the scenes. Every smooth interaction and responsive layout represents hours of wrestling with APIs, database queries, and making sure everything actually works together.\n\nIt's designed around digital health solutions because I believe technology should make healthcare more human, not less.

I was searching for something that would let me develop and deploy quickly without sacrificing quality, and honestly, Svelte blew me away.\n\nComing from React and other frameworks, Svelte felt refreshingly different. The learning curve wasn't as steep as I expected, and the development experience was surprisingly smooth. I managed to implement dynamic routing, a dark mode toggle, SEO optimization for each project page, and full responsiveness across devices - all while learning the framework from scratch.\n\nWhat impressed me most was how fast everything compiled and how little boilerplate code I needed to write. Svelte just gets out of your way and lets you focus on building. The hot reloading was instant, deployment was straightforward, and the final bundle size was tiny compared to what I was used to.\n\nThis project became both my portfolio and my Svelte playground. Every feature I added taught me something new about the framework, and I kept being surprised by how intuitive and powerful it is. If you're looking for a quick dev/deploy solution that doesn't compromise on performance or developer experience, I can't recommend Svelte enough.",
