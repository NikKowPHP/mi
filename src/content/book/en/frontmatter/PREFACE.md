### **A Note on Authenticity**

A fair warning: at first, these tools might feel clumsy. You may worry you are "performing" connection instead of feeling it. This is a normal and necessary stage of learning we call **The Rehearsal Phase**. Think of it as practicing musical scales; the first attempts are slow, mechanical, and sound nothing like music. The goal is to internalize the patterns so you can eventually forget them and simply play.

Be prepared, too, for others to notice this clumsiness. When you change the unwritten rules of a relationship, the system often pushes back. Your partner, colleague, or friend might say, "That sounds rehearsed," or "Don't use your 'therapist voice' on me." **This is not a failure; it is a signal that they are listening so closely they've noticed a change.** Your goal is not to be a perfect performer on day one. Your goal is to be a courageous student, willing to play a few wrong notes in service of learning better music. This book is your guide for moving from conscious, clumsy rehearsal to unconscious, authentic intuition.
