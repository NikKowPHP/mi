### **A Note on Authenticity**

A fair warning: as you begin, these tools might feel clumsy. You may worry you're 'performing' connection instead of feeling it. This is a normal and necessary stage of learning we call **The Rehearsal Phase**. Think of it like practicing musical scales; the first attempts are slow, mechanical, and sound nothing like music. The goal is to internalize the patterns so you can forget them and simply play.

Be prepared for others to notice this clumsiness, too. When you change the unwritten rules of a relationship, the system often pushes back. Your partner, colleague, or friend might say, "That sounds rehearsed," or "Don't use your 'therapist voice' on me." **This is not a failure; it is a signal that they are listening so closely that they've noticed a change.** Your goal is not to be a perfect performer from day one. Your goal is to be a courageous student, willing to sound a few wrong notes in the service of learning to make better music. This book is your guide from conscious, clumsy rehearsal to unconscious, authentic intuition.
