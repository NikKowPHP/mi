Of course. Here are descriptive prompts for an AI image generation system for each of the missing visuals, designed to be clear and effective.

### 1. For Chapter 3: The Amygdala Hijack Diagram

**Prompt:**
"Create a clean and minimalist educational diagram titled 'The Amygdala Hijack.' The image should show two simple, stylized outlines of the human brain side-by-side.

**Brain 1 (Left) - 'Calm State':**
*   The **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** at the front is highlighted in a cool, calm blue and labeled 'CEO Online.'
*   A small **Amygdala** in the center is labeled 'Guard Monitoring.'
*   Clear, straight arrows flow from the PFC to the rest of the brain, indicating rational control.

**Brain 2 (Right) - 'Hijacked State':**
*   The **Amygdala** is now much larger, glowing bright red, and labeled 'Guard ALARM!'
*   The **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** is grayed out or faded, with a 'static' or 'offline' effect over it. It's labeled 'CEO Offline.'
*   Jagged, chaotic arrows or lightning bolts emanate from the red Amygdala, showing it has taken over the brain's functions.

The overall style should be a modern infographic, with a white background and easy-to-read text."

### 2. For Chapter 4: The Empathy Loop Diagram

**Prompt:**
"Generate a simple and elegant circular flow diagram titled 'The Empathy Loop.' The style should be modern and clean, using a calming color palette of blues and greens on a white background.

The diagram should feature two main points connected by a continuous circular arrow to show a repeatable loop.

*   **At the top of the loop:** An icon of a question mark inside a speech bubble. It should be labeled '**1. The Switch**' with a smaller sub-label below it that reads: 'Ask an open "What" or "How" question.'
*   **At the bottom of the loop:** An icon of two arrows curving to mirror each other. It should be labeled '**2. The Playback**' with a smaller sub-label below it that reads: 'Summarize the underlying emotion you heard.'

The design should feel professional, clear, and easy to understand at a glance."

### 3. For Chapter 9: The Tension & Resolution Arc Graph

**Prompt:**
"Create a clean, easy-to-understand line graph for an infographic, titled 'The Tension & Resolution Arc.' The style should be minimalist and modern.

*   The **Y-axis** should be clearly labeled '**Tension**.'
*   The **X-axis** should be clearly labeled '**Time**.'
*   A single, bold line should plot the narrative arc across three distinct phases:
    1.  The line starts low and flat, labeled '**AND...** (The stable situation).'
    2.  The line then rises sharply and steeply to a peak, labeled '**BUT...** (The problem/tension).'
    3.  Finally, the line falls back down to a low, stable level, labeled '**THEREFORE...** (The resolution).'

The labels should be placed directly on the graph near their corresponding line segments. Use a white background and a single, strong color for the line."

### 4. For Chapter 10: The Social Brain Dashboard

**Prompt:**
"Design a sleek, modern digital dashboard interface titled 'The Brain's Social Radar: SCARF Model.' The image should look like a high-tech UI on a dark background.

Feature five semi-circular gauges arranged horizontally. Each gauge has a needle and a colored arc. The left half of the arc is red (labeled 'Threat') and the right half is green (labeled 'Reward').

Each gauge must be clearly labeled with one of the SCARF domains:
1.  **Status**
2.  **Certainty**
3.  **Autonomy**
4.  **Relatedness**
5.  **Fairness**

For this specific image, show a 'Threatened State':
*   The needles on the **Status**, **Certainty**, and **Relatedness** gauges are pointing far into the red 'Threat' zone.
*   The needle on **Autonomy** is pointing near the middle.
*   The needle on **Fairness** is in the green 'Reward' zone.

The gauges should have a subtle neon glow effect to enhance the digital look."

### 5. For the Appendix: Key Brain Regions Diagram

**Prompt:**
"Create a simple and clean medical illustration of the human brain in side-profile, designed for an educational appendix. The style should be minimalist with clear lines and a white background, not overly detailed.

The diagram should highlight three specific regions with distinct, soft colors and clear leader lines pointing to them.

1.  **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):** Color the entire front-most section of the brain light blue. Label it clearly.
2.  **Amygdala:** Show a small, almond-shaped structure deep inside the temporal lobe, colored light red. Label it clearly.
3.  **Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC):** Highlight this region along the medial frontal lobe, colored light green. Label it clearly.

The title of the diagram should be 'Key Brain Regions in Social Communication.'"

### 6. For the conductors_cheat_sheet.md: Full-Page Infographic

**Prompt:**
"Design a visually engaging, full-page infographic titled 'The Conductor Methodâ„¢ Cheat Sheet.' Use a modern, icon-driven style with a clean layout (like a three-column grid) and a consistent color palette.

The infographic must contain these distinct sections:

*   **Header:** The main title at the top.
*   **Section 1: The 3 Brains:** Three boxes, each with an icon, a title, and a brief description.
    *   '**Architect**' with a **blueprint icon**.
    *   '**Connector**' with a **bridge icon**.
    *   '**Sentinel**' with a **shield icon**.
*   **Section 2: The 5 SCARF Domains:** A central section listing the five domains: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness.
*   **Section 3: Core Protocols & Tools:** A list where each item has its own unique, simple icon.
    *   **[Lungs Icon] The Conductor's Breath**
    *   **[Reflecting Arrows Icon] The Empathy Loop**
    *   **[Handshake Icon] The Trust Protocol**
    *   **[Radio Signal Icon] The Safety Signal Protocol**
    *   **[Bullet Points Icon] The Clarity Protocol**
    *   **[Tension Graph Icon] The Tension & Resolution Arc**
    *   **[Gears Icon] The Feedback Protocols**
*   **Section 4: Emergency Protocol:** A visually distinct box, perhaps with a red outline, titled 'Emergency Protocol: The Hijack' with 3 numbered steps.

The entire image should be unified and well-organized, suitable for a quick reference guide."
